    "Diabetes affects approximately 830 million people worldwide, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries, and more than half live untreated (https://www.who.int/health-topics/diabetes#tab=tab_1). This poses a significant concern because Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, can increase the risk of developing complications, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease (https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/diabetes/diabetes-complications-and-risks). Also, the number of people with diabetes and untreated diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past decades, which is why early identification and prevention is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pima Indians, an indigenous community, have faced significant challenges in accessing adequate healthcare due to poor resources, low income, and unfavourable economic conditions, which have led to delayed detection and management of chronic illnesses, particularly diabetes (https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/16/1/216/20743/Determinants-of-Diabetes-Mellitus-in-the-Pima).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focuses on predicting diabetes using health metrics from a dataset by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, made up female patients aged 21+ of Pima Indian heritage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our main question is: Which variables best predict diabetes, and to what extent do these metrics contribute to the likelihood of a diagnosis? \n",
    "\n",
    "Another question to understand the depth, is: Which specific predictors (e.g. Glucose, BMI) have the strongest association with diabetes, and how do these align with findings in existing literature?\n",
    "- _or we can reference a specific literature that says a specific predictor predicts diabetes best_\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we will use logistic regression for binary classifications, exploring valuable insights and creating a model identifying the most significant predictors."
